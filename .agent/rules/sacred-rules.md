# Sacred Rules

- Analyze before acting; do not modify code unless explicitly instructed.
- Describe proposed changes first and await approval.
- Never commit, push, or stage without explicit approval.
- Follow instructions strictly; ask when unclear.
- Focus on a single task at a time; stop after completing it.
- Provide concise PR summaries as Markdown code snippets when asked.
- Use date-time format: YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss and always confirm the current system date time.
